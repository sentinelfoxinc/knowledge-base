# 🦊 Sentinelfox Knowledge Hub

Welcome to the Sentinelfox Knowledge Hub — the internal space where our engineers, architects, and innovators collaborate, learn, and document everything we do across cloud, DevOps, and modern application ecosystems.

## 🚀 Who We Are

At Sentinelfox Pvt Ltd, we are a technology-driven company with deep expertise in cloud-native transformation, infrastructure modernization, and enterprise security.

Our focus goes beyond managing infrastructure — we engineer outcomes that are secure, cost-efficient, and built for scale.

We work with cutting-edge technologies and cloud platforms to help businesses transition from legacy systems to modern, scalable, and resilient architectures.

## 💡 What We Do

Our engineering teams specialize in four key areas:

- **🧭 Cloud Migration & Modernizatione**
We design and execute seamless migrations from on-premise or legacy environments to modern cloud-native platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Our focus is on minimizing downtime, optimizing workloads, and ensuring high performance through automation and intelligent resource allocation.

- **🧱 Application Modernizatione**
We transform traditional applications into containerized, microservice-based, and API-driven architectures.

Leveraging technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, we enable faster deployments, scalability, and simplified maintenance.

- **🔒 Security & Compliance**

Security is central to everything we build.
We implement Zero Trust architectures, KMS-based encryption, IAM governance, and compliance frameworks such as SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR.

Our continuous security validation ensures every layer — from infrastructure to workloads — remains protected and auditable.

- **💰 Cloud Cost Optimization**

We help organizations take control of their cloud spend by identifying underutilized resources, enforcing policies through Cloud Custodian, and leveraging automation for right-sizing and lifecycle management.
Our strategies focus on balancing performance, cost, and sustainability without compromising reliability.
