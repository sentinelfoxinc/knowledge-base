# ☁️ Cloud Fundamentals

## 📖 Overview
Cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and GCP offer a wide range of services, including computing, storage, and networking, to help you build and deploy applications efficiently. If you’re just getting started, it’s best to focus on one cloud platform—**AWS** is highly recommended since it’s the most widely adopted. Once you’re confident with one provider, expanding your knowledge to others becomes much easier.

## 📌 Topics to Learn

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
- What is cloud computing?
- Benefits of using the cloud
- Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP offer a range of services like computing, storage, and networking that you can use to build and deploy applications.
- If you're just starting out, I recommend picking one cloud provider to focus on — **AWS** is a great choice because it’s the most widely used. Once you get comfortable with one, you can learn the others as needed.
- **Estimated Learning Time:** 3–4 weeks

## 2. Cloud Deployment Models
- Public, private, and hybrid clouds
- Multi-cloud strategy
- Choosing the right deployment model

## 3. Core Cloud Concepts
- Virtualization and scalability
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Elasticity and pay-as-you-go model

## 4. Major Cloud Providers and Essential Concepts

### AWS (Recommended)
- **EC2** – Virtual servers for compute workloads  
- **S3** – Object storage for data and backups  
- **IAM** – Identity and Access Management for security and permissions  
- **VPC** – Virtual Private Cloud for networking and isolation  
- **RDS** – Managed relational database service  
- **Lambda** – Serverless compute service  
- **CloudWatch** – Monitoring and logging tool  

### Azure
- **VMs** – Virtual machines for compute workloads  
- **Storage Accounts** – For storing blobs, files, and queues  
- **Networking** – VNets and NSGs for network and security configuration  
- **Azure DevOps** – CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery  

### GCP
- **Compute Engine** – Virtual machines for compute workloads  
- **Cloud Storage** – Object storage service  
- **Networking** – VPCs and Firewalls for network configuration  
- **Stackdriver** – Monitoring and logging platform  

## 5. Security and Compliance Basics
