# 🏗️ Infrastructure as Code

## 📖 Overview
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure using machine-readable configuration files instead of manual processes or interactive tools. IaC tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation automate the setup and management of cloud resources, improving efficiency, reducing errors, and ensuring scalability and consistency. Terraform is an excellent starting point due to its flexibility, simplicity, and broad community adoption.
