# 📊 Monitoring & Logging

## 📖 Overview
Monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and Fluentd help track the performance and health of your applications and infrastructure. Implementing effective monitoring and logging ensures reliability, stability, and high performance. These tools enable quick detection and troubleshooting of issues, helping maintain seamless operations. Prometheus is highly recommended for monitoring, especially when paired with Grafana for insightful visualization.
