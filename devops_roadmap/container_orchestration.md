# ☸️ Container Orchestration

## 📖 Overview
Orchestration tools such as Kubernetes and Helm automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. They are essential for running complex applications in production, ensuring smooth operation, easy scalability, and rapid recovery from failures. Kubernetes is the most widely adopted orchestration platform and an excellent starting point for learning container management.
