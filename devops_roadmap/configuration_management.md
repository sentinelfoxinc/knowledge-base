# ⚙️ Configuration Management

## 📖 Overview
Configuration management tools such as Ansible, Puppet, and Chef automate the deployment, configuration, and management of servers and applications. They play a vital role in maintaining consistency across your infrastructure by eliminating manual errors and automating repetitive tasks. These tools ensure that every server and application is configured accurately and uniformly. Ansible is a great starting point due to its simplicity, agentless architecture, and powerful automation capabilities.
