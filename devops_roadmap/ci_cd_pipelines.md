# ♾️ CI/CD Pipelines

## 📖 Overview
CI/CD is a methodology that automates the integration and deployment of code changes, enabling frequent and reliable software releases. CI/CD pipelines ensure that code is automatically tested and deployed, accelerating development while maintaining high quality. Jenkins is a powerful and versatile tool for building CI/CD pipelines, supported by a strong community. Other popular tools include GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, and Travis CI, but Jenkins is a great starting point for beginners.
